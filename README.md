# Negative Selection On Esperanto

### Summary
Esperanto is a constructed language intended to be "the international language". In this study we comprare Esperanto 
to 7 relatively similar languages: English (en), German (de), Polish (pl), Russian (ru), Greek (el), Latin (la) and 
French (fr). And to 4 more distant languages: Chinese (zh), Swahili (sw), Arabic (ar) and Hindi (hi). The aim is to 
evaluate how similar are those languages to Esperanto, as well as  assessing whether they are more similar 
orthographically or phonetically.
